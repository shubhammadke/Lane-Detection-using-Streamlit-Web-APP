# Lane Detection
In this project, we'll be detecting lane lines in videos and images of roads using the Computer Vision. Following lane lines is one of the most important traffic rules, so detecting them is a significant task while building models for autonomous(self-driving) vehicles. This project was hosted using Streamlit & deployed using Heroku.
